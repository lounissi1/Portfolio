# Data Science Portfolio



Repository containing portfolio of Data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. My other work is under confidentiality.



# Contents
##  1. Machine Learning

* [Suicide rate](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/suicide_rates/suicide_rate_investigation.ipynb)
* [Loan prediction](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Loan-classification/ML-Loan-classification.ipynb)
- ML Logistic Regression: Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
- ML Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public.
- k-Nearest Neighbors: We will use the Iris dataset for this work. The dataset was first introduced by statistician R. Fisher and consists of 50 observations from each of three species Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). For each sample, 4 features are given: the sepal length and width, and the petal length and width. The goal is to train kNN algorithm to distinguish the species from one another.

## 2. Data Analysis and Visualisation
 * Time Series Analysis: time series analysis of the financial data. Adjusted close prices for Facebook, 3M Company, IBM and Amazon for the last 60 days.


## 3. Deep Learning

* [Neural Network](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.py)

## 4. SQL
* [Database modeling and design](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Database%20modeling%20and%20design/01_schema.sql): Management of a transport company with several trucks. The objective of the project is to create a database. The first step is to model the subject. Then create the tables (CREATE TABLE), and fill them (INSERT and SQL Loader), Then create the programs that run in the RDBMS.
* Database management systems: Modeling and Design of a database.

## 5. Statistics and Probabilty for Data Science
## 6. Farming Decision Project
## 7. Applied Math Project
  * Spectral Discretization of a Naghdi Shell Model

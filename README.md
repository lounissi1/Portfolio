# Data Science Portfolio



Repository containing portfolio of Data science projects completed by me for academic or self learning. Projects from work are under confidentiality I've put just an overview .



# Contents
##  1. Machine Learning

* [Suicide rate](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/suicide_rates/suicide_rate_investigation.ipynb): An Analysis of Suicide Rates From 1985 to 2016,
prepared as the final project for Foundations of Data Science course at University of Toronto.
* [Loan prediction](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Loan-classification/ML-Loan-classification.ipynb): In this project, I build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

The dataset is from previous loan applications, I cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data. I used the following algorithms to build your models: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score and LogLoass.

- ML Logistic Regression: Predicting salary class of a person using logistic regression.
- ML Decision Trees and Random Forests: Using Decision Trees and Random Forests to classify schools as Private or Public.
- [k-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/k-Nearest%20Neighbors/k-Nearest%20Neighbors.ipynb) : We will use the Iris dataset for this work. The dataset was first introduced by statistician R. Fisher and consists of 50 observations from each of three species Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). For each sample, 4 features are given: the sepal length and width, and the petal length and width. The goal is to train kNN algorithm to distinguish the species from one another.

## 2. Data Analysis and Visualisation
 * [Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis/Time%20Series%20Analysis.ipynb): time series analysis of the financial data. Adjusted close prices for Facebook, 3M Company, IBM and Amazon for the last 60 days.
 * [Analyzing US Economic Data](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/US%20Economic%20Data/US%20Economic%20Data.ipynb): Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science; therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data. In this assignment, you will extract some essential economic indicators from some data, you will then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard. You can then share the dashboard via an URL.
 * [House Sales in King County, USA](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/House%20Sales/House_sales_code.ipynb): Determine the market price of a house given a set of features. Analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.

## 3. Deep Learning

* [Neural Network](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/NeuralNetwork/NeuralNetwork.py). A work that was done during a successful course entitled [Artificial Intelllegence (INF4230)](http://ericbeaudry.uqam.ca/INF4230/) at the university of Quebec in Montreal with Professor Eric Beaudry. 

Course Description:

Know the paradigms of artificial intelligence. To be able to formulate hypotheses for research, to test them, to interpret them and to present them. Be able to evaluate received ideas about artificial intelligence. History of artificial intelligence. Descriptive identification and goal reduction. Solving problems by analogy. Exploitation of natural constraints. Propagation of constraints. Research and exploration of alternatives. Decision and control. Problem solving paradigms. Mathematical logic and proof of theorems. Representation of knowledge. Natural language processing.

## 4. SQL
* [Database modeling and design](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Database%20modeling%20and%20design/01_schema.sql): Management of a transport company with several trucks. The objective of the project is to create a database. The first step is to model the subject. Then create the tables (CREATE TABLE), and fill them (INSERT and SQL Loader), Then create the programs that run in the RDBMS.
* [Database management systems](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Database%20project/00_modele.pdf.pdf): Modeling and Design of a database.

## 5. Statistics and Probabilty for Data Science
Learning Outcomes:
1. Design experiments to collect data that answer business or scientific questions.
2. Formulate statistical tests to answer business questions.
3. Use multiple linear and logistic regression as predictive models.
4. Use Python and R libraries for regression and Monte Carlo simulation.
5. Conduct a data analysis from both a classical and contemporary viewpoint.
## 6. Farming Decision Project

[Project Description:](https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/bioinformatics-and-artificial-intelligence-leverage-predictive-models-dairy-production)

* [Mixed Similarity Measure ](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Farming%20Decision%20Project/Lactanet_project_report.pdf): The main purpose of the project is helping dairy agriculture in decision-making process. Clustering analysis played an import role and it is considered as a precious tool to achieve this goal.  Traditionally, clustering approaches concentrate on purely numerical or categorical data only.  An important area of cluster analysis deals with mixed data, composed by both numerical and categorical attributes. Clustering mixed data is not simple, because there is a strong gap between the similarity metrics for these two kinds of data.  In this study we provide a mixed similarity measure (MSM) that could be used with mixed-data types.

* [Project](https://www.actualites.uqam.ca/2019/subvention-de-plus-de-1-M-de-genome-canada) funded by Genome Canada. This research is conducted by a multisectoral and transdisciplinary team made up of scientists from UQAM, Laval University and McGill University, in partnership with Valacta, the Quebec-Atlantic dairy production center of expertise, which aims to improve the profitability and sustainability of dairy farms by making producers aware of the many aspects of the technical and economic performance of their herd and their management. This study will also allow us to anticipate needs in this sector for other projects in the future.

## 7. Applied Mathematics Project
  * [Spectral Discretization of a Naghdi Shell Model](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Applied%20Math/spectral_descretization.pdf): We consider the Nagdhi equations which model a thin three-dimensional shell. We propose a spectral discretization of this problem in the case where the midsurface of the shell is weakly regular. We perform the numerical analysis of the discrete problem and prove optimal error estimates.
  
## 8. Unsteady aerodynamics and stall project
* [Aerodynamics comparaison](https://github.com/lounissi1/Portfolio/blob/main/Unsteady%20aerodynamics/Aerodynamic-PolyMtl.pdf): Comparative study of two models of
dynamic stall: model of Gormont and ONERA model. An analysis made during my work at Polytechnique Montreal.
